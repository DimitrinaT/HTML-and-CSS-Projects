		<p>Here is a list of 5 best music festivals around the world:</p>
	
		<h2><a href="https://www.tomorrowland.com" target="_blank">1. Tomorrowland (Belgium)</a></h2>
		<p>Taking place over three weekends in July in the Belgium town of Boom, 
		Tomorrowland is one of the most well-known and popular dance music festivals worldwide.</p>
	
		<h2><a href="https://www.coachella.com/" target="_blank">2. Coachella (California)</a></h2>
		<p>Coachella is a festival that should be on every music fan’s list.
		Held at the Empire Polo Club, in Indio, California, the festival was founded 23 years ago 
		and major stars and crowds have been flocking there ever since.
		Coachella showcases all kinds of musical genres, including rock, hip hop and dance. 
		It has also become famous for experimenting with new music trends and bringing them to the mainstream.

		<h2><a href="https://glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/" target="_blank">3.Glastonbury Festival (England)</a></h2>
		<p>Glastonbury celebrated its 50th birthday this year, with performances from 
		headliners Sir Paul McCartney, Billie Eilish and Kendrick Lamar.
		For many, the trip to Worthy Farm is an annual pilgrimage. 
		Tickets are snapped up within minutes of going on sale and the buzz around the line-up makes national news.
		The site itself becomes a small town, with its own newspaper, shops and, of course, the famous tented villages. 
		Just cross your fingers for good weather.

		<h2><a href="https://www.nojazzfest.com/" target="_blank">4.The New Orleans Jazz and heritage festival (USA)</a></h2>
		<p>The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival has been running since 1970 in a city steeped in music.
		While it started solely as a celebration of Louisiana’s rich musical, craft and culinary culture, 
		it has become a more commercial festival over the years.
		It does retain some of its original Cajun style, however, 
		and this is evident in the lively parades staged and stalls on offer throughout the event in late April/early May.

		<h2><a href="https://www.wacken.com/en/" target="_blank">5.Wacken Open Air (Germany)</a></h2>
		<p>Wacken is one of the biggest rock music festivals in Europe, taking place each year on the first weekend in August, in the village of Waken.
		From its beginnings in 1990, as a small event for local bands, it has become one of the largest festivals in the world.
		Almost all styles and subgenres of hard rock and metal are represented, drawing fans from around the world.
		And this summer, after a two year Covid-enforced hiatus, legends such as Slipknot, Limp Bizkit and Judas Priest will take to the stage.
